Revision history for Perl extension Class::Phrasebook.

0.2   Fri Feb  9 15:21:28 CET 2001
	- first distribution on CPAN
0.8   Sat Dec 15 19:44:09 CET 2001
	- Actually a very small fix, to have correctly the new lines 
	  from the XML source. 
	  Yet, I upgraded the VERSION number to 0.8, because we use
	  this class for quite a time now, and had no problems expect
	  this small fix.
