Revision history for Perl extension Class::Phrasebook.

	- The classes now use bytes. I did this change because I found  
	  out that the regular expressions sometimes work as unicode
	  and sometimes as bytes. What I prefer to have is kind of a
	  class switch that will let the user of the class choose if
	  he wants the class to run using 'bytes' or 'utf8'. I think
	  that if the user uses encoding="UTF8" in his XML, he should
	  be able to tell the class to run using 'utf8' pragma. But
	  in other cases, the user might want to run it using the
	  'bytes' pragma. But I don't know how to program such a
	  switch between pragams. Probably, if it is a problem for
	  you, you know more about unicode, and maybe you have an idea
	  how to solve it. So please write me your ideas.

        - Fixed the way the class reads the phrases from the XML file. 
          Specifically - fixed the way white characters are treated.
          Now the phrase will be accppted as it is between the tags 
	  and will include all the white characters there.
          Added the as_is_between_tags method, and the 
	  PHRASEBOOK_AS_IS_BETWEEN_TAGS environment to provide the 
          ability to get back to the old behavior of the classes -
          for legacy purposes.

	- The dictionaries are cached now in a class data.

	- At last the Devel::CallerItem is removed from this class.
	  Instead I use the caller build-in-function.0.8   

0.8   Sat Dec 15 19:44:09 CET 2001
	- Actually a very small fix, to have correctly the new lines 
	  from the XML source. 
	  Yet, I upgraded the VERSION number to 0.8, because we use
	  this class for quite a time now, and had no problems expect
	  this small fix.
