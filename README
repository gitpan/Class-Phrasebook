DESCRIPTION
  
  Class::Phrasebook implements the Phrasebook pattern. It lets us create
  dictionaries of phrases. Each phrase can be accessed by a unique
  key. Each phrase may have placeholders. Group of phrases are kept in
  a dictionary. The first dictionary is the default one - which means
  that it will always be read. One of the dictionaries might be used
  to override the default one. The phrases are kept in an XML
  document. 

  See The Phrasebook Pattern - Yonat Sharon & Rani Pinchuk - PLoP2K -
  http://jerry.cs.uiuc.edu/~plop/plop2k/proceedings/Pinchuk/Pinchuk.pdf
  for some reasons for using this class.

  Class::Phrasebook::SQL inherits from Class::Phrasebook and let us
  manage all the SQL code we have in a project, in one file. The is
  done by placing all the SQL statements as phrases in the XML file of
  the Class::Phrasebook.
